[TOWN MINI-HUB CONTENT: several short sections. Requirements:
- Question-based H2s (## in markdown) with the answer in the first sentence.
- GENUINELY local: drive time from the home base, this town's housing and
  tree/property stock and the service issues that follow, named landmarks
  and businesses, storm/weather patterns.
- 3–5 editorial links to service pages woven into sentences (in addition
  to the auto-generated related-services line), >=1 external validation
  link (Rule 45).
- ALSO REQUIRED: add "[Town]" to serviceAreas in src/config/business.ts
  so schema areaServed declares it.]
